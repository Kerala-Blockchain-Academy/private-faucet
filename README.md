# Ethereum-faucet

A simple ethereum facucet application for Private Networks.  

The application uses [Ether.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) to sign and send ether to the requesting address. The funding acount for the faucet is set as the etherbase account for the miner node in the private network.  

The funding account can be specified in two methods:

1. By specifiying seed phrase, on <b>FaucetInput.js</b> line no 52 also, uncomment the lines from 51 to 53 and comment the lines from 55 to 56

2. By providing the keystore file generated by geth, replace the file in the keyfile directory.

The RPC connection is sepcified in the <b>FaucetInput.js</b>

After the nessery changes are maede install dependencies using `npm i`  

Then run the application using `npm start`


The application does not makes any checks, so if the node is not running in the specifed RPC url, the application will bug out.
